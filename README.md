# Webpack Starter Kit
This is my simple webpack starter kit. It is build for static and React projects. It's a working starting point for most base projects. This starter also processes sass and es2015.

## To Begin!
* run `npm install` to install all packages and dependencies.

## Building and Serving
* run `npm run serve` to get a local server rolling. This setup uses [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to serve files.
* run `npm run watch` to build and watch js and css files.
* run `npm run build` to just build js and css files
